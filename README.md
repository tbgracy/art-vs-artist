An Art vs Artist Generator that allows users to create side-by-side comparisons of their artwork and themselves, following the popular trend on social media. This project serves as a fun and creative way for artists to showcase their work alongside their persona.

## 🤔 Why

When the #artvsartist trend came in 2023, I didn't have the motivation to open my template on GIMP (Windows and Mac users may use Photoshop) to make my #artvsartist. So I searched for an online generator and stumbled upon Artstation's generator but you needed an account to use it. So (there is a lot of "so") I decide to make my own quickly. As I was still new to React, I found in it an opportunity to upskill.

## ✨ How to use

You can watch a demo of how to use it [there](https://youtu.be/UhW0ufMM3Pk), and test it yourself [here](https://artvsartist.netlify.app/).
